### Hej there, I'm Niklas 👋

I'm a Geologist using Earth Observation techniques. Bridging the Complexity to Empower Users Decoding Climate Risks and Natural Hazards 🌍 🛰 Focussing on Flood Risk Management & Modelling 🌊

With [OpenSpaceData →](https://www.openspacedata.org/) I’ve founded an organisation with the mission to democratizing satellite data – through easy to use tools and education, and with [DisasterTech →](https://www.disaster-tech.org/), I led an international community of designers, developers, scientists and engineers to develop tools that help humans in crisis situations.

### Ask me about:
Decoding Climate Risks & Natural Hazards. Passionate about flood risks 🌊, geohazards ⚠️, weather 🌦️, remote sensing 🛰️, maps 🗺️, & risk comm 🚨. Also open data, low-cost technology, human rights & tech ethics. Yep, I have lots of interests. Oh wait, one more thing to know: I love rough weather!
