### Hej there, I'm Niklas 👋

I'm a Earth Observation Data Engineer. I explore different ways to use Earth observation technology with environmental impact and human rights in mind. I’m doing this professionally since 2008.

With [OpenSpaceData →](https://www.openspacedata.org/) I’ve founded an organisation with the mission to democratizing satellite data – through easy to use tools and education, and with [DisasterTech →](https://www.disaster-tech.org/), I’m leading an international community of designers, developers, scientists and engineers to develop tools that help humans in crisis situations.

I am passionate about natural hazards, Earth observation, climate, data science, open data, low-cost technology, human rights & tech ethics. Yep, I have lots of interests. Oh wait, one more thing to know: I love rough weather!

### Ask me about:
- 👨‍💻 Technology, with focus on exploring and defending Earth and society.
